    HIDS

        First of all, Intrusion Detection is the process or techniques used to detect 
        attacks on a specific network, system or application. Most intrusion detection 
        tools not only detect attacks, but also software misuse, policy violations and 
        other forms of inappropriate activities.

        A Host-based IDS performs intrusion detection from within the systems you want 
        to protect. Some of these tools perform log analysis, others spyware detection, 
        while others perform virus detection.

    LIDS

        LIDS (Log-based intrusion detection systems) is just a fancy term for tools that 
        perform security log analysis (specified above). It's goal is to detect misuse 
        (or attacks) using logs as the primary source of information. It is not a 
        replacement for NIDS (Network-based IDS) or any other security solution, 
        but an addition to them.
