CVE-2014-0160 (Heartbleed bug) Advisory for OSSEC
=================================================

The recently disclosed CVE-2014-0160 vulnerability – heartbleed read
overrun – in OpenSSL may impact OSSEC installations where OSSEC was
deployed with OpenSSL support, either when built from source or
installed from RPMs. In particular this issue leaves ossec-authd open to
attack.

The CVE-2014-0160 vulnerability has been fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.1g. OSSEC users
are advised to replace their existing OpenSSL shared libraries with
version 1.0.1.g which you can obtain as a source tarball on the OpenSSL
website here `<http://www.openssl.org/source/>`_. As of this writing
it does not appear that yum repositories for CentOS 6.x have pushed this
version of OpenSSL to the repository servers.

It is further advised that, until you patch your OpenSSL components, you
do not leave ossec-authd running when it is not receiving requests from
your OSSEC agents.
