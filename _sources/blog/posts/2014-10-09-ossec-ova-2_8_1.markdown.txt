=======================================
OSSEC Virtual Appliance 2.8.1 Available
=======================================

I have updated the OSSEC Virtual Appliance to include OSSEC 2.8.1 and
Elasticsearch-Logstash-Kibana (ELK) log management and the ElasticHQ
system to handle ELK monitoring. It is a single gzipped OVA that can be
easily imported into VirtualBox or any other virtualization system that
supports OVA files.

Look for it in the `Downloads section <../../downloads.html>`_.
