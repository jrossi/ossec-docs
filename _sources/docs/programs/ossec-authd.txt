ossec-authd
=============

The ossec-authd daemon will automatically add an agent to an OSSEC manager and provide the key to the agent.
The :ref:`agent-auth` application is the client application used with ossec-authd. 
`ossec-authd` will create an agent with an ip address of `any` instead of using its actual IP.

.. warning::

    By default there is no authentication or authorization involved in this transaction, so it is recommended that 
    this daemon only be run when a new agent is being added.

ossec-authd argument options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. program:: ossec-authd

.. option:: -D <dir>

    chroot to ``<dir>``.

.. option:: -d

    Execute ossec-authd in debug mode. This option can be used multiple times to increase the verbosity of the debug messages.

.. option:: -g <group>

    Run as ``group``.

.. option:: -h

    Display a help message.

.. option:: -i

    Add agents with a specific IP address instead of using ``any``.

.. option:: -k <path>

    Full path to the server key.

.. option:: -p <port>

   Listen on port.

   **Default** 1515

.. option:: -t

    Test the configuration.

.. option:: -V 

    Display OSSEC Version and license information.

.. option:: -v <path>

    Full path to the CA certificate used to verify the clients.

    .. note::

       This option was added after 2.8.1.

.. option:: -x <path>

    Full path to the server certificate.

    .. note::

       This option was added after 2.8.1.



Creating SSL keys
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ossec-authd`` requires SSL keys to run. This process will create the necessary keys in ``/var/ossec/etc`` and allow ``ossec-authd`` to start:

.. code-block:: console

  # openssl genrsa -out /var/ossec/etc/sslmanager.key 2048
  # openssl req -new -x509 -key /var/ossec/etc/sslmanager.key -out /var/ossec/etc/sslmanager.cert -days 365


Without the key ``ossec-authd`` will give the following error:

.. code-block:: console

  [user@ossec-manager] :; sudo /var/ossec/bin/ossec-authd  
  2012/04/18 11:05:01 ossec-authd: INFO: Started (pid: 20669).
  2012/04/18 11:05:01 ossec-authd: ERROR: Unable to read certificate file (not found): /var/ossec/etc/sslmanager.cert
  2012/04/18 11:05:01 ossec-authd: ERROR: SSL error. Exiting.

If the default locations of /var/ossec/etc/sslmanager.cert and /var/ossec/etc/sslmanager.key are not suitable then the
-x and -k options can be used to specify alternative locations.

.. _optional-client-authentication:

Optional Client Authentication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``ossec-authd`` can verify that connecting agents present a valid X.509 certificate when requesting a key. This is optional
and is only useful if hosts in your environment are assigned certificates when they're provisioned (or at some point before
being added to OSSEC). If agent certificate verification is desired then the relevant CA certificate must be loaded with the
-v option. This will cause ``ossec-authd`` to verify that agents present a valid certificate when requesting a key. If an
agent does not present a certificate or presents an invalid certificate then the agent will not be allocated a key.

A certificate presented by an agent may be found to be invalid for the following reasons:

- It was not signed by the specified CA.
- It is expired.


ossec-authd example usage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Example: Running ossec-authd
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

    # /var/ossec/bin/ossec-authd -p 1515 >/dev/null 2>&1 &

And the logs when an agent is added:

.. code-block:: console

    2011/01/19 15:04:40 ossec-authd: INFO: New connection from 192.168.10.5
    2011/01/19 15:04:41 ossec-authd: INFO: Received request for a new agent (example-agent) from: 192.168.10.5
    2011/01/19 15:04:41 ossec-authd: INFO: Agent key generated for example-agent (requested by 192.168.10.5)
    2011/01/19 15:04:41 ossec-authd: INFO: Agent key created for example-agent (requested by 192.168.10.5) 

Example: Running ossec-authd with client authentication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: console

    # /var/ossec/bin/ossec-authd -v /var/ossec/etc/CA.cert -d

If debug output is enabled then "Peer verification requested" will be displayed when starting.

.. code-block:: console
